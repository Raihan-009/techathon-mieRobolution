# MIE ROBOLUTION 1.0

## Integrated Hardware & Software Challenge [Event Techathon]

## INTRODUCTION

Welcome to MIE Robolution 2025, an innovative competition designed to test participants' skills in both hardware and software problem-solving through an immersive, story-driven experience. This unique competition combines algorithmic challenges, mathematical problem-solving, database queries, and hardware implementation into a sequential adventure where each solution provides a clue to unlock the next challenge.

Unlike traditional hackathons, MIE Robolution focuses on the intersection of hardware and software expertise, encouraging participants to think holistically about technological solutions. Teams will embark on an 8-hour journey that tests their ability to work under pressure, collaborate effectively, and apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems.

This rulebook outlines the competition format, scoring system, eligibility requirements, and guidelines to ensure a fair and rewarding experience for all participants.

## COMPETITION FORMAT

### Story-Driven Structure
- The competition follows a linear story format where problems are connected sequentially.
- Each solved problem provides a crucial clue needed to unlock and solve the next challenge.
- Teams must solve challenges in order, with no option to skip ahead.

### Challenge Categories
1. **Algorithmic Problem Solving**
   - Implementation of efficient algorithms
   - Analysis and optimization of time and space complexity
   - Adherence to specified constraints

2. **Mathematical Expressions**
   - A-level mathematical problems requiring analytical skills
   - Application of mathematical concepts to practical scenarios
   - Derivation and proof of solutions

3. **Database Queries**
   - Implementation of RAW SQL queries (no ORM allowed)
   - Database design and optimization challenges
   - Data extraction and analysis tasks

4. **Hardware Implementation**
   - Circuit design and troubleshooting
   - Fault detection and diagnosis
   - Implementation of hardware solutions based on specifications

5. **Final Presentation**
   - Teams must create and deliver a presentation about their hardware implementation
   - Explanation of design choices, challenges faced, and solutions implemented

## SCORING SYSTEM

### Hidden Initial Score
- Each team will be assigned a hidden initial score that will only be considered if they complete all problems within the timeline.
- Each problem has a fixed time allocation and a fixed point value associated with it.

### Time-Based Scoring
- For each second of elapsed time during the competition, 0.5 points will be deducted from all teams.
- Each problem has a designated time limit (e.g., 60 minutes for a particular problem).
- If a team completes a problem before its time limit expires, the remaining time points will be added to their initial hidden score.
  - Example: If a problem is worth 900 points with a 60-minute time limit, and a team completes it in 40 minutes, 300 points (20 minutes × 0.5 points/second × 60 seconds/minute) will be added to their initial hidden score.

### Submissions and Penalties
- The first submission for each problem will be evaluated for scoring.
- Each incorrect submission incurs a 5-minute penalty (equivalent to 150 point deduction).
- Multiple incorrect submissions for the same problem will accumulate penalties.

### Ranking
- The team with the highest final score will be declared the Champion.
- The team with the second-highest score will be the Runner-Up.
- In case of a tie, the team that completed the challenges in less time will be ranked higher.

## RULES AND GUIDELINES

### Software Problem Solving
1. All database queries must be written in RAW SQL without using any ORM frameworks.
2. Algorithms must be implemented with consideration to the specified time and space complexity requirements.
3. Code must be well-documented with clear explanations of the approach used.
4. Solutions must pass all test cases to be considered correct.

### Hardware Implementation
1. Teams must bring their own hardware components for the competition.
2. A list of required minimal components will be published one week before the event.
3. Circuit implementations must adhere to safety standards and specifications.
4. Documentation of hardware design and implementation is mandatory.

### Resource Usage
1. Use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI tools is permitted for assistance.
2. Consultation with external experts via meeting platforms (Zoom, Google Meet, etc.) is strictly prohibited.
3. Internet access is allowed for reference materials and documentation.
4. Pre-written code or solutions are not permitted.

### Time Management
1. The competition will run for 8 hours, including breakfast and lunch breaks.
2. Time spent during breaks will still count toward the overall competition time.
3. All submissions must be completed within the allotted time frame.

## ELIGIBILITY AND TEAM REQUIREMENTS

### Participant Eligibility
- Open to undergraduate students and college students only.
- All participants must provide valid student identification during registration.

### Team Formation
- Teams must consist of exactly 2-3 members.
- Cross-institutional teams (members from different universities/colleges) are allowed.
- Solo participation is not permitted.

### Team Leadership
- Each team must designate one member as the team leader.
- The team leader will be responsible for:
  - Official communication with organizers
  - Team coordination
  - Submission of solutions
  - Representing the team in official matters

### Team Modification
- Once registered, no substitutions of team members are allowed.
- Any necessary changes to team composition must be approved by event organizers before the competition.

## AWARDS & RECOGNITION

### Prizes
- Champion: Trophy, Certificates, and Prizes (will be announced)
- Runner-Up: Trophy, Certificates, and Prizes (will be announced)

### Certificates
- All participants will receive a certificate of participation.
- Special recognition may be given for outstanding performance in specific challenge categories.

## DISQUALIFICATION

Teams may be disqualified from the competition for the following reasons:

1. Unprofessional conduct or lack of sportsmanship at any point during the competition.
2. Failure to adhere to the allotted presentation time limits.
3. Contesting or disrespecting the judging panel's decisions.
4. Any form of misconduct, including disrespect toward judges or other participants.
5. Evidence of external consultation with experts during the competition.
6. Plagiarism or use of pre-prepared solutions for the challenges.
7. Tampering with other teams' equipment or submissions.

The decision of the organizers regarding disqualification is final and binding.
